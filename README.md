# RAG Chatbot for Astronomy 2e using Mistral 7B-Instruct v0.3 🚀

### This repository contains the code for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot trained on the Astronomy 2e textbook. The chatbot utilizes Mistral 7B-Instruct v0.3, to generate accurate and context-aware responses based on the book’s content.

## 📌 Overview
🔹 Implements a RAG pipeline for enhanced information retrieval
🔹 Uses Mistral 7B-Instruct v0.3 as the LLM for response generation
🔹 Stores processed textbook data in a vector database
🔹 Allows users to ask astronomy-related questions and receive AI-generated responses
🔹 The chatbot is not deployed – it runs entirely within the provided notebook


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹Mistral 7B-Instruct v0.3 (LLM)
🔹Hugging Face Transformers
🔹Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook


## ⚠️ Notes
🔹 This is a code repository – the chatbot is not deployed.
🔹 The notebook allows testing the chatbot within a local/Colab environment.
🔹 Ensure you have access to the Astronomy 2e textbook to generate embeddings.
